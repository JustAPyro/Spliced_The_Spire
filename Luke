Luke's place for ideas and stuff:

Stuff to talk about for 4/18 (or next meeting)
-> Start a team trello?
-> Set up a google calendar to try and schedule regular meetings?
-> Come up with a flowchart- What are our phases, what do we want to accomplish, and how can we divide the work?
-> Go over abstract classes real quick and the AbstractEffect changes I made- Maybe I'll set up abstracts and @mhanna3141 can do individual implementations?
-> Am I being micro-managey? I don't want to overrun the project, just want to make sure we keep it organized and effective. It's a cool idea and I want to wrap it up.
-> Compare our plans to decapirate-the-spire... That has theSilent up (all cards/relics) and developing content first approach
